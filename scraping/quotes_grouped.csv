                      by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did
                      do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe

                      Dream. Discover."
"J.K. Rowling,","If you want to know what a man's like, take a good

                      sure as hell don't deserve me at my best. | I believe that everything happens for a reason.
                      People change so that you can learn to let go, things go
                      wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right, you
                      believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but
                      yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better
                      things can fall together."
Mark Twain,"If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember

"Martin Luther King Jr.,","Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can
                      do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do
                      that."
Maya Angelou,"I've learned that people will forget what you said,
                      people will forget what you did, but people will never
                      forget how you made them feel."
Narcotics Anonymous,"Insanity is doing the same thing, over and over
                      again, but expecting different results."
Oscar Wilde,"Be yourself; everyone else is already taken. | To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most
                      people exist, that is all. | Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so
                      much."

"Stephen Chbosky,",We accept the love we think we deserve.
Steve Jobs,"Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels.
                      The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The
                      ones who see things differently. They're not fond of
                      rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You
                      can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify
                      them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.
                      Because they change things. They push the human race
                      forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we
                      see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to
                      think they can change the world, are the ones who
                      do."
William W. Purkey,"You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,"
